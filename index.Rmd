# Introduction

## Preliminaries

R package validation for regulatory environments can be a 
tedious endeavour.
The authors firmly believe that under the current regulation,
there is no such thing as a 'validated R package':
validation is by definition a process conducted by the *user*.
This validation report merely aims at facilitating 
validation of **[adoptr](https://github.com/kkmann/adoptr)** as 
much as possible.
No warranty whatsoever as to the correctness of **adoptr** nor the
completeness of the validation report are given by the authors.

We assume that the reader is familiar with the notation an theoretical
background of **adoptr**.
Otherwise, the following resources might be of help:

* **adoptr** online documentation at https://kkmann.github.io/adoptr/
* paper on the theoretical background of the core **adoptr** functionality [?????]
* a general overview on adaptive designs is given in [@Bauer2015] 
* a mote extensive treatment of the subject in [@Wassmer2016].



## Scope

**adoptr** itself already makes extensive use of unittesting to 
ensure correctness of all implemented functions. 
Yet, due to constraints on the build-time for an R package, 
the range of scenarios covered in the unittests of **adoptr** is 
rather limited.
Furthermore, the current R unittesting framework does not permit 
an easy generation of a human-readable report of the test cases
to acertain coverage and test quality.
Therefore, **adoptr** splits testing in two parts: technical 
correctness is ensured via an extensive unittesting suit in **adoptr**
itself (aiming to maintain a 100% code coverage).

The validation report, however, runs through a wide range of possible
application scenarios and ensures plausibility of results as well
as consistency with existing methods wherever possible.
The report itself is implemented as a collection of Rmarkown documents
allowing to show both the underlying code as well as the corresponding 
output in a hman-readable format.

The online version of the report is dynamically re-generated on a 
daily basis using the Travis-CI service based on the respective 
most current version of **adoptr** on CRAN.
The result of this daily build is available at https://kkmann.github.io/adoptr-validation-report/.
To ensure early warning in case of any test-case failures, 
formal tests are implemented using the **testthat** package 
[@R-testthat].
I.e., the combination of using a unittesting framework, a continuous 
integration, and continuous deployment service leads to an always 
up-to-date validation report (build on the current R release on Linux).
Any failure of the integrated formal tests will cause the build status
of the validation report to switch from 'passing' to 'failed' and
the respective maintainer will be notified immediately.



### Validating a local installation of adoptr

Note that, strictly speaking, the online version of the validation
report only provides evidence of the correctness on the respective 
Travis-CI cloud virtual machine infrastructure using the respective 
most recent release of R and the most recent versions of the 
dependencies available on CRAN.
In some instances it might therefore be desireable to conduct a
local validaton of **adoptr**.

To do so, one should install **adoptr** with the `INSTALL_opts` option
to include tests and invoke the test suit locally via
```r
install.packages("adoptr", INSTALL_opts = c("--install-tests"))
tools::testInstalledPackage("adoptr", types = c("examples", "tests"))
```
Upon passing the test suit successfully, the validation report
can be build locally.
To do so, first clone the entire source directory and switch
to the newly created folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkmann/adoptr-validation-report.git
cd adoptr-validation-report
```
Make sure that all packages requied for building the report are
available, i.e., install all dependencies listed in the top-level
`DESCRIPTION` file, e.g.,
```r
install.packages(c(
    "adoptr", 
    "tidyverse", 
    "bookdown", 
    "rpact", 
    "testthat", 
    "pwr" ) )
```
The book can then be build using the terminal command
```bash
Rscript -e 'bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_format = "all")'
```
or directly from R via 
```r
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_format = "all")
```
This produces a new folderr `_book` with the html and pdf versions
of the report.



## Validation Scenarios



### [Scenario I: Large effect, point prior](#scenarioI)

This is the default scenario. 

* **Data distribution:** Two-armed trial with normally distributed test statistic
* **Prior:** $\delta\sim\delta_{0.4}$
* **Null hypothesis:** $\mathcal{H}_0:\delta \leq 0$

    2. $TOER := \boldsymbol{Pr}\big[c_2(X_1) < X_2\,|\,\delta=0.0\big] \leq 0.025$
    3. Three variants: two-stage, group-sequential, one-stage. 
* **Formal tests:**
    1. Number of iterations are checked against default maximum to ensure proper
      convergence.
    2. All three **adoptr** variants (two-stage, group-sequential, one-stage) 
        comply with constraints. Internally validated by testing vs. simulated 
        values of the power curve at respective points.
    3.  Is $n()$ of the optimal two-stage design monotonously decreasing on
        continuation area? 
    4. $ESS$ of optimal two-stage design is lower than $ESS$ of optimal
        group-sequential one and that is in turn lower than the one of the
        optimal one-stage design.
    5. $ESS$ of optimal group-sequential design is lower than $ESS$ of 
        externally computed group-sequential design using the [rpact](https://rpact.org/) package.

## Technical Setup

All scenarios are run in a single, shared R session.
Required packages are loaded here,
the random seed is defined and set centrally, and the default number
of iteration is increased to make sure that all scenarios 
converge properly.
Additionally R scripts with convenience functions are sourced here as well.
There are three additional functions for this report.
`rpact_design` creates a two-stage design via the package **rpact** [@R-rpact]
in the notation of **adoptr**.
`sim_pr_reject` and `sim_n` allow to simulate rejection probabilities
and expected sample sizes respectively by the **adoptr** routine `simulate`.
Furthermore, global tolerances for the validation are set. 
For error rates, a relative deviation of $1\%$ from the target value is 
accepted. 
(Expected) Sample sizes deviations are more liberally accepted up to $0.5$.
